# Tell me more
_Greyhound_ is powered by [PDAL](http://www.pointcloud.org/) which handles data abstraction for a wide variety of formats.  See the [client documentation](https://github.com/hobu/greyhound/blob/master/doc/clientDevelopment.rst) and the [administrator documentation](https://github.com/hobu/greyhound/blob/master/doc/administration.rst) for more details on development and deployment.

A simple [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) HTTP protocol, or its equivalent [WebSocket](https://www.websocket.org/) interface, is used to query and stream points in a format specified by the client.
